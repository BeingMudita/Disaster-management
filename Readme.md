<b>Disaster Management App</b>

<b>🚀 Overview</b>

The Disaster Management App is an innovative platform designed to enhance disaster response and relief efforts. By leveraging AI/ML, blockchain, and real-time location tracking, this application aims to provide early disaster predictions, real-time alerts, shelter information, and a secure donation system to ensure timely and efficient aid distribution.

<b>🌍 Problem Statement</b>

Lack of Proper Response and Relay Mechanisms in India

When disasters strike in India, the absence of an efficient response and relay mechanism leads to delayed aid, inefficient resource allocation, and increased suffering for affected communities. Our goal is to create a centralized disaster response and inventory management system that leverages technology to predict disasters, manage responses effectively, and ensure timely resource allocation.

<b>🎯 Objectives</b>

<b>Real-time Alerts</b>: Notify users of impending disasters based on historical data and location tracking.

<b>Shelter Locator</b>: Help affected individuals locate government and NGO-run shelters nearby.

<b>Secure Donations</b>: Utilize blockchain to ensure transparent and secure disaster relief donations.

<b>AI/ML Prediction</b>: Analyze disaster-prone areas to improve disaster preparedness.

<b>Post-Disaster Support</b>: Provide access to government policies, NGO resources, and rehabilitation support.

<b>🛠️ Tech Stack</b>
